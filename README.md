# UE4 kata

My goal was to develop a _kata_; that is, an exercise that can be repeated many times in order to sharpen one's skills.  This one intends to cover many fundamentals of Unreal game development.

A beginner would need to learn everything from scratch, while an experienced developer can progress through it in a fairly straightforward way.  Significantly, both developers would benefit from repeated iterations of the exercise.

The code in this repository is my first attempt to follow this exercise.

## Topics covered
- Blueprints
- C++
- Functional tests
- Multiplayer/replication
- User input
- Timing and simple animation
- Broadcasts
- Sound effects
- Particle effects

## The spec:
>The player can shoot at a cube.  After taking a number of hits, the cube is destroyed.  On destruction, particle and sound effects play.  It supports multiple players.
>
>Functionality should be covered by tests where possible.
>
>Start from Unreal's C++ _Third Person_ demo.
